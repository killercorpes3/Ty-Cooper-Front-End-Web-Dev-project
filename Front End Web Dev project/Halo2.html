	<h1>Welcome to halo 2!</h1>
	<h2>Where we </h2>

	<p> The game starts on High Charity, the Covenant's capital city. Commander Thel 'Vadamee is on trial for his failure to protect Halo, and he is found guilty by the Hierarchs. 'Vadamee is stripped of his rank and marked with the Mark of Shame by Tartarus, the Chieftain of the Jiralhanae. Meanwhile, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 receives new armor from the Master Gunnery Sergeant on Earth's Orbital Defense Platform Cairo Station. John-117 is taken to an awards ceremony overseen by Fleet Admiral Terrence Hood. The Covenant Siege of Earth begins when Cortana reports "15 Covenant Capital Ships holding position just outside the kill zone." UNSC Marine forces, along with John-117, protect the station from the invading Covenant Naval infantry. The Prophet of Regret leads the Covenant Army, and after the UNSC defenses halt the invasion force, Regret flees Earth with Miranda Keyes, Captain Keyes' daughter, in pursuit on the UNSC In Amber Clad. The disgraced Commander Thel 'Vadamee is given the chance of redemption by the High Prophets of Truth and Mercy in taking up the mantle of Arbiter. Thel 'Vadamee is tasked with the assassination of a Heretic Leader, who is disillusioned with the Covenant following the events of Installation 04 up to its destruction. Keyes and John-117 land on the surface of Installation 05 with ODSTs to remove Regret. <p>

	<p> In the course of pursuing Regret, John-117 discovers that the Prophet intends to activate Halo to propel true believers on the Great Journey. Keyes decides that Regret's death warrants his death, which John-117 successfully achieves. The Covenant and High Charity attempt to kill John-117 by glassing the area, but he jumps into the lake surrounding Regret's location. John-117 is last seen being dragged into the depths of the lake by the tentacles of the Gravemind. Thel 'Vadamee is sent to recover the Sacred Icon to light the new Halo ring. Making his way through the Quarantine Zone facing scores of Flood and Sentinels on the surface of Installation 05 seeking the Activation Index, Thel 'Vadamee captures the Index along. <p>
