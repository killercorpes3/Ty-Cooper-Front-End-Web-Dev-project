<div style="height: 800; overflow: auto;">

	<p> The games storyline is about a team of ODSTs who are preparing to capture the Covenant Prophet of Regret aboard his CAS-class assault carrier hovering near the city's Orbital Elevator. The team is composed of Corporal Taylor "Dutch" Miles, Lance Corporal Kojo "Romeo" Agu, Private First Class Michael "Mickey" Crespo, and the Lance Corporal "Rookie," who is asleep at the start of the mission. Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck is their team leader. They are deployed via SOEIV "drop pods" to infiltrate and capture the Prophet of Regret. However, the plan goes awry when the Assault Carrier proceeds to enter Slipspace, closely followed by the Stalwart-class light frigate UNSC In Amber Clad. An EMP emitted by the Slipspace rupture disables the drop pods before they are able to deploy their parachutes, causing the ODSTs to scatter across New Mombasa. The Rookie, who survived the fall, sets out to find his squadmates, encountering Covenant patrols and finding clues along the way. <p>

	<p> The game's story begins on October 20th, 2552 at around 4:00pm, where a team of ODSTs are preparing for a mission on board the UNSC Say My Name, which is orbiting high above New Mombasa, Kenya. The ODSTs are gathered around a holo-table, which shows the Covenant Prophet of Regret's CAS-class assault carrier hovering near the city's Orbital Elevator. The team consists of Corporal Taylor "Dutch" Miles, Lance Corporal Kojo "Romeo" Agu, Private First Class Michael "Mickey" Crespo, and the Lance Corporal "Rookie", who is sleeping in the back of the room. <p>

	<p> Romeo jokes about how the UNSC Navy managed to put up a fight during the Invasion of Earth, but still allowed a Covenant carrier to slip by the Orbital Defense Platforms surrounding the planet. Dutch criticizes Romeo's comment, stating that the navy left the lone ship for the Marines to infiltrate. However, their conversation is interrupted when their team leader, Gunnery Sergeant Edward Buck, enters the room with an attractive ONI operative named Veronica Dare. Romeo greets Dare by saying "Hello, beautiful," which catches Buck's attention and prompts him to order the ODSTs to their SOEIV "drop pods." <p>

	<p> While on their way to the armory, Buck is stopped by Dare, who informs him that the members of his squad are replacements. Buck acknowledges the issue but notes that after 27 years of war with the Covenant, very few veterans are left in the UNSC. He confronts Dare about the objective of his team, stating that the Assault Carrier carrying the Prophet of Regret is a more vital concern than her covert mission. Dare reminds Buck that they have orders to follow and that she should be referred to as "Captain" in keeping with military regulations. <p>

	<p> Buck directs Dare to her pod, where Romeo asks about her mission. Buck, obviously angry about the mission, confronts the curious Lance Corporal, replying that she is their "new boss." He gives a motivating speech to his team and hands a SRS99D Sniper Rifle to Romeo, drawing questions from the squad who were anticipating a close-range battle inside the Covenant Assault Carrier. While en route to his own drop pod, Romeo rudely awakens the Rookie, hitting him with the butt of his rifle. Dutch pushes Romeo out of the way and hands the Rookie a silenced SMG, telling the ODST to relax despite Romeo's obnoxious behavior. The Rookie's pod is then closed, spun around, and lowered into the launch bay to begin drop preparations. <p>
