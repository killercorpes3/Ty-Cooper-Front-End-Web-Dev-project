<div style="height: 800; overflow: auto;">

	<p> In 2559, the UNSC flagship Infinity arrives at Zeta Halo, but it is ambushed and boarded by the Banished. Master Chief is defeated by Atriox and dropped into space, but six months later, he is found by a UNSC pilot who is trying to flee from the Banished. However, Master Chief insists on continuing the fight, and they travel to Zeta Halo, which has been severely damaged by an unknown calamity. On the ring, Master Chief locates the Weapon, an AI designed to imitate Cortana in order to capture and delete her. However, the Weapon failed to delete herself, and Master Chief experiences visions of Cortana's residual data. <p>

	<p> Zeta Halo is now controlled by the Banished, led by Escharum after Atriox's apparent death. Master Chief, the Weapon, and the Pilot rally scattered UNSC forces on the ring's surface. Inside the Forerunner installation known as the Conservatory, Master Chief encounters Despondent Pyre, the Monitor of Zeta Halo, who attempts to warn him of a threat contained within the installation. However, she is destroyed by the Harbinger, an alien who has allied with the Banished to free her people, the Endless, who were imprisoned by the Forerunners on Zeta Halo. <p>

	<p> The Pilot reveals that he was a civilian engineer aboard Infinity who stole a Pelican to flee the battle. The Chief comforts him, admitting his own guilt over his failure to save Cortana. Master Chief and the Weapon stop Zeta Halo's repair process by disabling a series of spires on the ring. When the Harbinger attempts to hack the Weapon, the Chief activates a failsafe to delete the AI. However, the Weapon repels the Harbinger and deactivates the failsafe, asking why Master Chief does not trust her. After seeing a vision of Cortana using the Guardians to destroy the Brutes' home planet, the Weapon realizes that she is a copy of Cortana and insists that Master Chief delete her. However, Master Chief refuses, stating that he wants to trust her. <p>

	<p> The Pilot is captured by Jega 'Rdomnai, a Sangheili Spartan killer and a close friend of Escharum, as bait for Master Chief. Master Chief infiltrates the House of Reckoning and saves him, defeating Jega 'Rdomnai and Escharum in the process. Master Chief and the Weapon head to the Silent Auditorium to stop the Harbinger. They learn that Cortana was captured by Atriox after the Weapon locked her down, and upon realizing that Atriox intended to use the ring, she destroyed herself, damaged Zeta Halo, and prevented the Weapon from being deleted. In a recorded message, Cortana says goodbye to the Chief and encourages him to work with the Weapon. The Chief defeats the Harbinger, but she contacts someone regarding the Endless.<p>

	<p> Afterwards, the Weapon and Chief reunite with the Pilot, who reveals that his real name is Fernando Esparza. The Weapon chooses a name for herself, and the trio prepare to liberate the rest of the Ring from the remaining Banished. In a post-credits scene, an alive Atriox uses a key to unlock a sealed door, leading to the Endless. If the game is finished on Legendary difficulty, the scene features dialogue between Despondent Pyre and the Forerunner Grand Edict about the imprisonment of the Endless, and the deployment of the AI Offensive Bias to assist her. <p>
