	<h1>Welcome to Halo Reach!</h1>
	<h2>Where we first meet the Pillar of Autumn </h2>

	<p> Halo: Reach is set on the fortress world of Reach, prior to the events of the first Halo game. The game follows Noble Team, a squad of Spartan supersoldiers, who are ordered to investigate the loss of transmission from the Visegr√°d Relay Communications Outpost. However, they discover that the Covenant is responsible for the outage and that they have invaded the planet. As the UNSC attempts to halt the brutal alien invasion, Noble Team is deployed to Sword Base for defensive purposes, where they learn that the Covenant is searching for information on their religion. <p>

	<p> As the Covenant forces arrive on the planet, Noble Team is dispatched on various missions to defend the planet, including attacking Covenant bases and removing fortified defenses. When a massive supercarrier arrives, Kat comes up with a plan to strike back at the Covenant by sneaking a Slipspace Bomb onto the Ardent Prayer. However, when the detonator malfunctions, Jorge sacrifices himself to destroy the carrier, and a larger Covenant fleet arrives to continue the assault. Six regroups with the rest of the team to assist with the evacuation of the planet. <p>

	<p> Colonel Holland recalls Noble Team to Sword Base to destroy the data and artifacts that the Covenant is seeking. The team is entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence, Cortana, and the information she carries regarding an ancient Forerunner artifact to the UNSC Pillar of Autumn. Carter is mortally wounded during the journey, and the team encounters a Scarab. Carter sacrifices himself and the team's Pelican to destroy the Scarab. Emile is slain by Elite Zealots, and Six kills them and the Field Marshal, opting to remain on Reach and take Emile's place at the gun while the Autumn escapes. <p>

	<p> The game concludes with the opening scene of Halo: Combat Evolved, in which Cortana discovers Installation 04, followed by the credits and a personal message of thanks from Bungie. The post-credits scene puts the player in control of Noble Six's last stand against overwhelming Covenant forces. Six eventually casts aside their helmet and is overwhelmed by a group of Sangheili. The game ends with a narration by Halsey eulogizing Noble Team's sacrifice and the rejuvenation of Reach over thirty years later. <p>
