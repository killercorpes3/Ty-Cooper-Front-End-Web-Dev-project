<div style="height: 800; overflow: auto;">

	<p> In the year 2559, the UNSC Spirit of Fire, which had been presumed lost with all hands, arrives at the Ark, a massive Forerunner installation capable of building Halo rings. The ship's AI, Serina, who had developed rampancy due to a long service life, wakes the crew from cryosleep before destroying herself as per protocol. The crew, led by Captain James Cutter, is unaware of the current situation or the nature of the Ark. Cutter sends Spartan Red Team to investigate a UNSC signal coming from the surface. When they arrive, they find a UNSC research base that has been attacked, and they are ambushed by an immensely powerful Jiralhanae. The Spartans retreat with Logistics AI Isabel and find out that the Covenant has been replaced by the Banished, a huge horde of ex-Covenant warriors and pirates led by the cunning Brute warlord Atriox, who had attacked them. The Human-Covenant War is over, but the Banished pose a far greater threat. Isabel urges the Spirit of Fire to run, but Cutter decides to fight against the Banished, knowing that his ship is all that stands between Atriox and humanity. <p>

	<p> The UNSC starts by surgically weakening Atriox's command structure by taking out his subordinate leaders. They discover the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark, and ascend to the map room. Meanwhile, Alice, one of the Spartans, rescues UNSC POWs and raids Banished forces, making them fight on two fronts. Anders discovers that Atriox has hijacked the Arkâ€™s portal network and tries to shut it down. Decimus arrives, but this time he is killed, and the network is shut down, dealing two heavy blows to Atriox's efforts. <p>

	<p> Above the Ark, the Spirit of Fire engages the Banished's CAS-class Assault Carrier, the Enduring Conviction. The Spirit of Fire does not have the firepower to take down the carrier, but Anders comes up with a plan on how to escape back to UNSC-controlled space. They launch the Halo ring, which has Slipspace capability, and use its gravity systems to eject the last of the Banished troops into space. However, before the Spirit of Fire can follow, the Halo, with Anders on it, enters Slipspace, exiting too early and encountering a Guardian, a huge Forerunner construct. <p>
