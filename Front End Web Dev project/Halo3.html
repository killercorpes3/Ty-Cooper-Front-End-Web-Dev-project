	<h2>Where we </h2>

	<p> In Halo 3, Master Chief (John-117) crash-lands on Earth after his previous encounter with the Forerunner 'Dreadnought' in Halo 2. He is rescued by Sergeant Major Avery Johnson and a small group of marines who take him to a UNSC base called Crow's Nest. There, Commander Miranda Keyes and Lord Hood plan to stop the Covenant from activating a Forerunner artifact called the Ark which, if activated, will activate the Halo Array and wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy. John-117 and a small group of marines are tasked with punching a hole in Truth's anti-air defenses so that Lord Hood can initiate a low-level air-strike on the artifact. However, the Covenant Loyalists attack the UNSC base and destroy it. John-117 regroups with the surviving marines and makes his way into the African City of Voi. After destroying the Covenant anti-air defenses, Lord Hood leads Earth's military ships against Truth and the artifact. The Flood arrives and infects the city of Voi. <p>

	<p> The Fleet of Retribution arrives to assist the UNSC, and John-117 retrieves Cortana from the Flood-infested Covenant cruiser. She tells him that the Gravemind is coming to Earth with an army of Flood and that the solution to the Flood infestation is on the other side of the portal, without having to fire the rings. Lord Hood and his UNSC forces remain on Earth to defend it against the incoming Flood invasion while Commander Keyes, John-117, and the Elites journeys through the portal. They arrive at the Ark and must deactivate three shield generators in three separate towers to access the Control Room of the Ark. After the final shield barrier protecting the Control Room deactivates, the Flood-infested High Charity arrives via slipspace and crashes onto the Ark, releasing many Flood dispersal pods and flood-infested rocks. The remaining UNSC and surviving Sangheili forces assault the Citadel containing the Control Room, which is heavily defended by Covenant Loyalist forces. Truth captures Johnson and reveals to his followers that he intends to activate all of the remaining Halos in the galaxy. Keyes crashes into the Control Room, knowing she must kill Johnson and herself to stop the rings from being activated. From behind, Truth kills Keyes with a Spiker and activates all of the remaining Halos in the galaxy. <p>
