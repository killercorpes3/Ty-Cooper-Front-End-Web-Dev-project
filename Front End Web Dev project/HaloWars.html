	<h1>Welcome to Halo Wars!</h1>
	<h2>Where the story begins</h2>

	<p>It begins in the year 2531, 21 years prior to Halo: Combat Evolved, during the Covenant eradication of the Outer Colonies in the Human-Covenant war. <p>

	<p> Glassing, also known as plasma bombardment, refers to Covenant orbital bombardment using heavy plasma weaponry. <p>

	<p> The game is set in 2531 and focuses around the Marine forces of the UNSC Spirit of Fire as they engage Covenant ground forces after the discovery of an ancient artifact during a journey to the partially glassed Harvest. <br> Harvest, (or CE-309-8 d by the Forerunners) was a UEG (Unified Earth Government) Agriculture World. It is the most remote at the time of its founding. Located in the Epsilon Indi system, the planet had the unfortunate distinction of being the first human planet discovered and destroyed by the Covenant. After disastrous First Contact, the planet was subsequently glassed by the Covenant during the First Battle of Harvest, but most of its population managed to escape in freighters. <p>

	<p> Freighter is a classification for interstellar vessels. These ships are neither armed nor well protected, they consist almost entirely of cargo bay space for their transported goods. Many Freighters are operated entirely by computers and managed by planetary AIs, however some are still crewed by humans. <p>
	
	<p> Arcadia was a Unified Earth Government colony located in the Procyon system that was established in 2429 and was one of the Outer Colonies. <p>

	<p> The story of "Halo Wars" begins with Captain Cutter recounting UNSC's battles on Harvest. He deploys UNSC forces to the planet's surface to reinforce Sergeant Forge at Alpha Base. When Alpha Base is attacked and destroyed by the Covenant, survivors flee to the surrounding areas. Forge leads them in an assault to remove the Covenant presence and return Alpha Base to operational status. During a patrol, Forge discovers a Forerunner relic occupied by Covenant forces. He then leads an assault to remove the Covenant so that Professor Anders may examine it. The relic points to another UEG colony world, Arcadia, which holds "something of great interest to the Covenant." The Spirit of Fire deploys Grizzly tanks to cut through the Covenant and link up with Forge and his Marines. They eventually travel to Arcadia and find that most of the orbital defense ships have been destroyed. UNSC forces then withdraw to a defensible area on the city outskirts, holding off Covenant attacks long enough for Spartan Group Omega to arrive and assist in the destruction of local Covenant forces. <p>

	<p> The Covenant has erected a large energy shield generator around a site of importance containing several Forerunner ruins, forcing the UNSC to deploy prototype Rhino plasma artillery to penetrate it. The UNSC comes under attack from a Super Scarab, but they manage to destroy it. Anders and Forge begin documenting the area, only for the Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee to arrive, taking Anders prisoner and wounding Sergeant Forge. The Spirit of Fire is forced to pursue the Covenant and captured Anders. Deploying ground forces to search for Anders, the UNSC and Covenant forces come under attack from a previously undiscovered alien organism - the Flood. The Spirit of Fire is locked in a field and pulled into the opening, while UNSC forces withdraw back to the ship from a concentrated Flood force, narrowly escaping annihilation. <p>

	<p> The Spirit of Fire is then guided through a docking system that removes Flood growths from the ship's hull. This occurs as the ship moves through a system of concentric rings that filter out Flood biomass. The ship then emerges inside a massive Shield World, immediately engaging a Covenant Destroyer and fending off attacks while conducting repairs. Meanwhile, The Arbiter uses Anders to activate The Apex site, revealing a fleet of Forerunner warships. With the Covenant forces distracted by their new fleet, Anders manages to escape and link up with Forge and his Marines. The crew removes the Spirit of Fire's FTL Reactor, planning to detonate it and destroy the Shield World and the fleet. The plan would deny it to the Covenant and save humanity from near total defeat and extinction. <p>

	<p> With the reactor damaged, Forge stays behind to detonate it manually, while the rest of the UNSC forces activate a portal to escape the Shield World and retreat to the Spirit of Fire. The ship begins its long journey home, likely to take many years or decades. In a final cutscene, Sgt. Forge's cryo tube is closed by Captain Cutter, who briefly nods, upon which the camera pans down to find the words "Sgt. J. Forge," acknowledging his sacrifice for all of humanity. In the final moments of the credits, Serina speaks the final words of the game, saying "Captain. Wake up. Something has happened," as the logo fades to black. <p>
