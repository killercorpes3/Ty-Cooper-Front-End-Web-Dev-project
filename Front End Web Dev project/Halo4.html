	<p> In the game Halo 4, which takes place four years, seven months, and ten days after the events of Halo 3, John-117, also known as Master Chief, awakens from cryosleep to find that an unknown assailant has boarded his ship, UNSC Forward Unto Dawn. As he battles through the ship, he discovers that it is not just one rogue Covenant ship, but an entire fleet orbiting a Forerunner world. Cortana, his AI companion, reveals that she is exhibiting the first stages of Rampancy, a condition that affects AIs. They must fight their way through Covenant forces to find a way back to Earth to seek help for Cortana. Eventually, they find themselves on a planet called Requiem, where they receive a signal from UNSC Infinity asking for help. They must take down two jamming towers to receive the full signal and discover that the ship is going to enter the planet. <p>

	<p> They attempt to warn the ship away, but the Didact, a Forerunner warrior, appears and declares that his people are returning to the galaxy. John escapes and eventually finds Commander Thomas Lasky and Spartan Commander Palmer, who help him fight off the Covenant and Prometheans, who have joined forces. They are given a mission to allow Infinity to escape Requiem, and with the help of the Librarian, they learn about the Didact's plan to turn the Composer, a powerful Forerunner weapon, on humanity. Cortana is decommissioned due to Rampancy, and John-117 attempts to destroy the Didact. However, he is unsuccessful, and boards a Lich to follow the Didact into slipspace. They arrive at Halo Installation 03, where the Didact's Covenant attack the UNSC science facility orbiting the Halo. John battles his way inside, but he is unable to stop the Didact from activating the Composer. <p>
